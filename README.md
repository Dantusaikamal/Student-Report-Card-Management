### Built With

* [C++]()


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To reproduce my code, download and extract the source code and open the Student_Report_Card_Management.cpp and run it in your favourite compiler!

### Prerequisites

It would be best if you are familiar with the following concepts in C++ before jumping right into the project:

* C++ basics and syntax
* Functions in C++
* Scope resolution in C++
* File handling.


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## About the project


![alt text](https://github.com/Dantusaikamal/Student-Report-Card-Management/blob/main/image.PNG?raw=true)

Our project can be used to store, retrieve, display, insert, delete and modify  a student's marks in their subjects. The program is completely menu driven and there is no Graphical interface provided (It will be taken care in future releases)  



<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

This is our Mini Project for the subject Object Oriented Programming with C++, which we have submitted in our 2nd year, 1st Semester during the academic year 2020-21. 

Here's the requirements listed for the project: 
```
This C++ mini project on STUDENT REPORT CARD has student class with data members like roll no, name, marks and grade. Member functions in this class are used for accept / display details of students and a function to calculate grade based on marks obtained by student. Student Records are stored in binary file.
This menu driven program illustrates read, write, search, modify and delete operations in binary file
```

Hence we have only added the listed requirements in the report card system. More features will be added in the coming releases.
